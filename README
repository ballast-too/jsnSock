** jsnSock **

jsnSock is a high-level TCP network sockets library done in c++11 syntax.
As the C++11 standard is relatively new, an up-to-date compiler package
is necessary to build this project.  An up-to-date list of C++11 capable
compiler packages can be found at the following url:

http://wiki.apache.org/stdcxx/C%2B%2B0xCompilerSupport

The Makefiles expect g++ (>=4.7) to exist, but if clang++ is preferred, it is
supported:  (http://clang.llvm.org/get_started.html)

# pushd path/to/jsnSock

# export CLANG_PATH=/path/to/clang++
# make
# sudo make install

# pushd examples
# make


Backstory:

This project is a teaching tool in-the-making.
C++11 syntax is signficantly different to that of C++03 -- enough
to merit a "from scratch" approach to teaching as opposed to a
"here are the differences" approach: http://http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%2B%2B11

This source also serves as an introduction to basic TCP sockets on UNIX platforms.
Updates to this project will come in the form of project 'forks' so as to preserve
the learning path.  The next update will add UDP support and address issues where
the kernel "decides" to not completely send a data stream (resulting in packet fragmentation).
