** jsnSock **

jsnSock is a high-level TCP network sockets library done in c++11 syntax.
As the C++11 standard is relatively new, an up-to-date compiler package
is necessary to build this project.  An up-to-date list of C++11 capable
compiler packages can be found at the following url:

http://wiki.apache.org/stdcxx/C%2B%2B0xCompilerSupport

The Makefiles expect g++ (>=4.7) to exist, but if clang++ is preferred, it is
supported:  (http://clang.llvm.org/get_started.html)
